# `dep/` Folder

The `dep` folder is a directory to store project dependencies or third-party libraries that are required for the functioning of our project. By maintaining these dependencies separately, we aim to ensure that they are easily accessible, versioned, and managed.

Whenever possible, we must use package managers, such as [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). In these cases, external libraries and dependencies must not be included in the repository.
