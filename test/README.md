# `test` Folder

The `test` folder is a directory with the primary purpose of facilitate automated testing of the project. Automated testing is a crucial component of development, as it helps ensure code quality, reliability, and functionality.

We expect that our project most be available with unit and e2e testing scripts. We suggested [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
