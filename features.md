# GitHub Repository Features Overview

This repository leverages several GitHub features to streamline collaboration, documentation, and project management. Here’s a brief guide on how we use **Wikis**, **Projects/Milestones**, **Discussions**, and **Actions** to support development.

### Wikis

**Wikis** in GitHub repositories provide a centralised space for documentation and detailed information about the project. They can be organised into multiple pages, making them ideal for:

- **User Guides**: Comprehensive usage guides for the project.
- **Technical Documentation**: Detailed breakdowns of the codebase, API references, or architectural decisions.
- **Onboarding Information**: Guides for new contributors, including setup instructions and coding guidelines.
- **Reference Material**: Glossary, FAQs, and any additional resources relevant to the project.

> **Tip**: Wikis are often used for long-form documentation that may be too detailed for the main `README.md` file.

### Projects and Milestones

**Projects** and **Milestones** help manage work within a repository by tracking progress and organising tasks.

- **Projects**: GitHub Projects act as kanban-style boards where issues and pull requests can be organised into columns. This makes it easy to visualise the project’s status and track tasks in stages (e.g. "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").
    - Projects can be used to track specific **sprints**, **features**, or even long-term goals.
    - You can prioritise tasks, assign team members, and add notes to provide more context to each task.

- **Milestones**: Milestones allow you to group issues and pull requests by a common goal or release. They’re typically used to:
    - Track progress towards major releases or deadlines.
    - View all issues and PRs associated with a specific goal.
    - Understand how close the team is to completing a planned feature set.

> **Example**: For a version release, a milestone called `v1.0` could contain all issues and PRs related to that release, making it easier to monitor and close tasks before launching.

### Discussions

**Discussions** provide a space for open-ended conversation within the repository. They’re useful for:

- **General Questions**: Users and contributors can ask questions, discuss ideas, or seek help with specific issues.
- **Feature Requests and Ideas**: A place to propose new features and gather feedback from the community.
- **Announcements**: Updates about major changes, new releases, or project milestones.
- **Community Engagement**: Discussions help foster a community around the project, encouraging feedback and knowledge sharing.

> **Note**: Discussions are great for topics that don’t fit into Issues or PRs, especially those that don’t have a clear action item.

### Actions

**GitHub Actions** allow you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository. They’re commonly used for:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically run tests on each push or pull request to ensure code quality.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automate deployment of the application to various environments (e.g., staging, production).
- **Automated Tasks**: Run scripts to handle repetitive tasks, like formatting code, syncing documentation, or notifying stakeholders.
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Perform tasks at scheduled intervals (e.g., nightly builds, weekly issue cleanups).

In this repository, we use GitHub Actions to ensure code consistency, run tests, and streamline our deployment process. By automating these workflows, we improve efficiency and reduce the likelihood of human error.

> **Example**: A CI workflow that runs tests on each pull request, ensuring that new code passes tests before being merged into the main branch.
