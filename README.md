# Project Name

A brief description of your project goes here.

A `README` file should contain only the information necessary for developers to start using and contributing to your project. Longer documentation is better suited to [wikis](https://github.com/sergiomrebelo/ldc-repository-example/wiki).

## Table of Contents

If your `README` is very long, consider incorporating a table of contents to facilitate navigation for users.

    - [RoadMap](#Roadmap)
    - [Getting Started](#getting-started)
        - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
        - [Installation](#installation)

Remember to replace `[Project Name]`, `[License Name]`, and the content under each section with the appropriate information for your project. Additionally, you can add more sections or customize it further to suit your project's specific needs.

Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem – they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.
