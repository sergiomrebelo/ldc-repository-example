# Project Name

A brief description of your project goes here.

A `README` file should contain only the information necessary for developers to start using and contributing to your project. Longer documentation is better suited to [wikis](https://github.com/sergiomrebelo/ldc-repository-example/wiki).

## Table of Contents

If your `README` is very long, consider incorporating a table of contents to facilitate navigation for users.

### Environment Variables
Many projects utilise a `.env` file (or similar) to manage environment variables.
